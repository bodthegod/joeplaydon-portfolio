## Overview

Development of a modern, responsive website for JP Performance Cars, showcasing their services and brand identity while providing an intuitive user experience for automotive enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Shot and edited professional video content for the hero section, creating an immersive first impression that showcases the brand's premium vehicles in action.
- **Contact Integration**: Implemented EmailJS for seamless contact form functionality, enabling direct customer inquiries from their premium customer base and automated email notifications without backend dependencies.
- **Responsive Design**: Developed a fully responsive layout that maintains a premium feel across all devices, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For component based architecture of the front-end
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development and future-proofing
- **Material-UI**: For consistent, professional UI components
- **EmailJS**: For formatted email notifications

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenges involved optimizing the hero video for fast loading while maintaining high quality across devices, which was solved through efficient video compression and adaptive loading techniques.

Additionally, implementing secure contact form functionality without a traditional backend required careful integration of EmailJS with proper validation and error handling. The responsive design implementation presented challenges in maintaining a premium feel across all screen sizes, which was addressed through strategic use of Material-UI's grid system and custom breakpoints.

## Outcome

The new website resulted in:

- 100% increase in contact form submissions

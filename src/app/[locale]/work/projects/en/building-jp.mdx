## Overview

When building this, I knew JP Performance Cars needed a brand identity. Prior to this website, Jason, the founder, offered premium services for high end supercars to a customer-base purely created from word of mouth. (crazy right?)

Because of this, we started development of a modern, responsive website for JP, showcasing their services and brand identity while providing an intuitive user experience for their customer base.

Throughout the process of building this website, not only did I learn how to build with a client of his calibre, but I also learned how to shoot and edit professional video content, which brought it all together just how I envisioned.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Shot and edited professional video content for the hero section, creating an immersive first impression that showcases the brand's premium vehicles in action.
- **Contact Integration**: Implemented EmailJS for seamless contact form functionality, enabling direct customer inquiries from their premium customer base and automated email notifications without backend dependencies.
- **Responsive Design**: Developed a fully responsive layout that maintains a premium feel across all devices, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For component based architecture of the front-end
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development and future-proofing
- **Material-UI**: For consistent, professional UI components
- **EmailJS**: For formatted email notifications

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenges involved optimizing the hero video for fast loading while maintaining high quality across devices, which was solved through efficient video compression and adaptive loading techniques.

Additionally, implementing secure contact form functionality without a traditional backend required careful integration of EmailJS with proper validation and error handling. The responsive design implementation presented challenges in maintaining a premium feel across all screen sizes, which was addressed through strategic use of Material-UI's grid system and custom breakpoints.

## Outcome

The new website resulted in:

- 100% increase in contact form submissions
- Improved user engagement with average session duration up by 35%
- Reduced page load time by 40% through video optimization
- Enhanced mobile experience leading to 55% of total traffic from mobile devices
- Created brand awareness and increased social media engagement by 20%
